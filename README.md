# Recession Predictor

Economic recessions and depressions cause substantial damage to people and businesses well-being. One of the biggest problems with how our economic system handles these events is that we are unable to accurately forecast them resulting in sudden panicked realizations that the economy is contracting, deepening recessions destructive power.  By improving our ability to anticipate these macroeconomic events, we can enable economic actors to plan better which will result in a smoother economic cycle. Using machine learning, I predict the probability a contraction in real GDP will occur in the current month, one month out, three months out, and in the next year.
